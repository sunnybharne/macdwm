## Quick Start

### Method 1: Pre-built Binary (Recommended)

1. **Download the binary:**
   - Go to [Releases](https://github.com/sunnybharne/macdwm/releases)
   - Download the latest `macdwm` binary
   - Save it to your Downloads folder

2. **Make it executable:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   chmod +x macdwm
   ```

3. **Grant Accessibility permissions:**
   - Open **System Settings** (Apple menu ‚Üí System Settings)
   - Go to **Privacy & Security** ‚Üí **Accessibility**
   - Click the **+** button
   - Navigate to your Downloads folder and select **macdwm**
   - Make sure the toggle is **enabled** (green)

4. **Run macdwm:**
   ```bash
   ./macdwm
   ```
   - Look for a terminal icon in your menu bar
   - If you see it, macdwm is running!

5. **Test it:**
   - Click on any window to focus it
   - Press `Option+Ctrl+Left` - the window should tile to the left half
   - Press `Option+Ctrl+Right` - the window should tile to the right half

### Method 2: Homebrew (Alternative)

```bash
brew tap sunnybharne/tap
brew install macdwm
